* [The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0#ref-CR21), Moncrieff et al. 2022: comprehensive review of the major strands of research on serotonin shows there is no convincing evidence that depression is associated with, or caused by, lower serotonin concentrations or activity; most studies found no evidence of reduced serotonin activity in people with depression compared to people without, and methods to reduce serotonin availability using tryptophan depletion do not consistently lower mood in volunteers
* [Prospective biomarkers of major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6974432/), Kennis et al. 2022: no biomarkers (neuroimaging, GI, immunology, neurotrophic, neurotransmitters, hormones, and oxidative stress) except cortisol predict MDD (but effect disappears after correcting for disease state) i.e. no evidence for any _causal_ biomarkers of depression
* [Quantifying Deviations of Brain Structure and Function in Major Depressive Disorder Across Neuroimaging Modalities](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2794429), Winter et al. 2022: (n=1,800) group differences in neuroimaging markers explained less than 2% variance

* [High Intelligence is not a Risk Factor for Mental Health Disorders](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.26.22275621v1), Williams et al. 2022: Individuals with high g-factors had less general anxiety (OR=0.69) and PTSD (OR=0.67), were less neurotic (β=-0.12), less socially isolated (OR=0.85), and were less likely to have experienced childhood stressors and abuse, adulthood stressors, or catastrophic trauma (OR=0.69-0.90); they did not differ in any other mental health disorder or trait
* [Genome-wide association study of antisocial personality disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5048197/), Rautiainen et al. 2022: first study showing genome-wide significant (n=6,000) and replicable (n=4,000) findings on genetic variants associated with any personality disorder

* [The function of efference copy signals: Implications for symptoms of schizophrenia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698912003616), Pynn 2013: it is hypothesised that when one speaks, a copy of the efferent signals is sent to the auditory cortex where sensation is suppressed only when the anticipated voice matches the actual voice (sensory reafferent); failure in this “corollary discharge” may explain schizophrenic patients’ deficits in discriminating between self generated vs externally generated auditory sensations

Covid
* [Vaccine effectiveness of one, two, and three doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac against COVID-19 in Hong Kong: a population-based observational study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00345-0/fulltext), McMenamin et al. 2022: (n=21,000) in HK where no prior outbreak (hence population immunity) confounds analysis, 2-dose BioNTech’s efficacy against severe disease or death in adults aged 60+ was 89·3% [95% CI 86·6–91·6]) compared with CoronaVac’s 69·9% [64·4–74·6]; 3 doses (third being BioNTech) 97·9% [97·3–98·4]

* Sarah Constantin: [Personalized Medicine For Real](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TKk7rShf9d5ePN7vR/personalized-medicine-for-real): “personalised medicine” is many things — healthcare optimisation for basically healthy people (superficial personalisation on top of generic lifestyle advice), stratifying treatment based on genes (we don’t know enough about how genes affects treatment effects), preventing medical error (building a “smart hospital” that runs on checklists, statistical prediction rules, outcomes monitoring, and other evidence-based practices is epically hard), AI diagnosis (irreducible dependence on how you frame the problem), connecting patients with experimental therapies (consulting/software to match patients with clinical trials), changing clearly mismatched standard practice to match scientific evidence (hard to scale), and of course n=1 translational medicine for rare diseases (requires actual therapeutic development expertise)
