* [What is the medical evidence on non-therapeutic child circumcision?](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-021-00502-y), Deacon et al. 2022: no benefit, rare harms; the most often cited benefit of HIV prevention is solely based on circumcision of adult males who were having unprotected heterosexual intercourse in sub-Saharan Africa; only 0.6% of boys suffering from pathological phimosis require circumcision so it’s nonsensical to circumcise dozens of boys just to prevent a latter circumcision; per 100 circumcisions needing to be performed to avoid 1 UTI, 10 boys would need antibiotics for post-operative wound infection
* [Managing Emotions: The Effects of Online Mindfulness Meditation on Mental Health and Economic Behavior](https://www.adviksh.com/files/in_progress/sv_mindfulness.pdf), Shreekumar et al. 2022: economists find that (n=2,400) free access to mindfulness meditation app causes a 0.44 SD reduction(!) of symptoms of stress, anxiety depression; increases earnings on proofreading task by 2%; makes decision-making more stable across emotional states

Meta-medicine:
* [Effect of a Novel Mindfulness Curriculum on Burnout During Pediatric Internship: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2788279), Fraiman et al. 2022: mindfulness courses are completely useless compared to social lunches on the levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, burnout, empathy, and mindfulness

Epidemiology:
* [Longitudinal analysis reveals high prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus associated with multiple sclerosis](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222), Bjornevik et al. 2022: multiple sclerosis is _caused_ by EBV; risk of MS increased 32x with EBV infection from 955 cases in cohort of 10M in US military (mechanism still elusive)
* [A comprehensive map of genetic relationships among diagnostic categories based on 48.6 million relative pairs from the Danish genealogy](https://www.pnas.org/content/119/6/e2118688119.long), Athanasiadis et al. 2022: (n=6.7M) heritability estimates for mental disorders were consistently the highest across demographic cohorts, whereas estimates for cancers were the lowest:

* [Do “Moderate” Drinkers Have Reduced Mortality Risk? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Alcohol Consumption and All-Cause Mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803651/), Stockwell et al. 2016: (n=4M) no significant reduction in mortality risk was observed for low-volume drinkers (RR = 0.97, 95% CI [0.88, 1.07])
* [Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618313102), GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators: the level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm across health outcomes was zero (95% UI 0·0–0·8) standard drinks per week, largely because the estimated protective effects for ischaemic heart disease and diabetes in women are dwarfed by monotonic associations with cancer; see comment in [No level of alcohol consumption improves health](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext)

Covid
* [SARS-CoV-2 emergence very likely resulted from at least two zoonotic events](https://zenodo.org/record/6291628#.YhqGFZZOk2w), Pekar et al. 2022, and [The Huanan market was the epicenter of SARS-CoV-2 emergence](https://zenodo.org/record/6299600), Worobey et al. 2022: SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity early in the COVID-19 pandemic points to emergence via repeated zoonotic events; geographical clustering of the earliest known COVID-19 cases and the proximity of positive environmental samples to live-animal vendors suggest that the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was the site of origin of the COVID-19 pandemic; the remaining open question is how it got to the market, from an animal who passed it to people or from a person who got infected at the lab and took it to the market 
* [Long-term cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3), Xie et al. 2022: n= 12M
    ![](/images/2022-03-01-January-February-2022-News/image1.png)
* [mRNA-1273 or mRNA-Omicron boost in vaccinated macaques elicits comparable B cell expansion, neutralizing antibodies and protection against Omicron](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.03.479037v1), Gagne et al. 2022: an Omicron boost may not provide greater immunity or protection compared to a boost with the current mRNA-1273 vaccine
* [Myocarditis Cases Reported After mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccination in the US From December 2020 to August 2021](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788346), Oster et al. 2022: n=1626 cases of myocarditis, rates were highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent males aged 12 to 15 years (70.7 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), in adolescent males aged 16 to 17 years (105.9 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), and in young men aged 18 to 24 years (52.4 and 56.3 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine, respectively)
* [The Long Long Covid Post](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2022/02/10/the-long-long-covid-post/): I’m glad Zvi did the hard work so I don’t have to
1. Long Covid is real, but less common than many worry it is
2. Reports of Long Covid are often people who have symptoms, then blame them on Long Covid whether or not they even had Covid, the exception is loss of taste and smell
3. Long Covid severity and risk is proportional to Covid severity and risk.
4. If you didn’t notice you had Covid, you’re at very very low risk for developing Long Covid
5. Vaccination is thus highly but incompletely protective against Long Covid
6. Children are thus at minimal risk
7. Omicron is thus less likely to cause serious Long Covid than Delta
8. My current estimate of the forward-looking-practical-use chance of a healthy non-elderly person getting serious, life-impacting Long Covid from a case of Omicron is about 0.2%, or 1 in 500. This number will decline further once Paxlovid is readily available
9. Long Covid remains the primary downside of contracting Covid while young and healthy
10. Diseases often have long-term negative health effects. Long Covid is not fundamentally so different from Long Other Disease. If you are worried going forward about Long Covid you should consider things like permanently not living in a city to avoid diseases
11. A lot of people are in poor health; it is likely worthwhile to treat your health a lot more seriously than most people do, irrespective of Covid
12. The Precautionary Principle carries some weight in all this
13. Remember that the chance of preventing a Covid case via additional Covid prevention, going forward, even with extreme measures, is not all that high.
14. If you compare the potential costs of Long Covid to the costs of Long Covid Prevention, it is obvious the second is a bigger threat
15. Short-term additional vigilance is reasonable but rapidly becoming less reasonable
16. Using Long Covid as a reason for not returning to normal once case levels come down would not be reasonable

* [The Fourth Law of Behavior Genetics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721415580430), Chabris et al. 2015:
    1. All human behavioural traits are heritable.
    2. The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.
    3. A substantial portion of the variation in complex human behavioural traits is not accounted for by the effects of genes or families.
    4. A typical human behavioural trait is associated with very many genetic variants, each of which accounts for a very small percentage of the behavioural variability.

* [A Skeptic's Guide to Modern Monetary Theory](https://t.co/OjvqDhmkEE), Mankiw et al. 2020: while the government can always print money to pay its bills, it doesn’t free the government from its intertemporal budget constraint;  while the economy normally operates with excess capacity, it doesn’t mean policymakers only rarely need to worry about inflationary pressures; in a world of pervasive market power, government price setting might improve private price setting as a matter of economic theory, but it doesn’t imply that actual governments in actual economies can increase welfare by inserting themselves extensively in the price-setting process
