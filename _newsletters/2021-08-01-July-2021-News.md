#### Medicine

Therapeutics:

* The first Alzheimer's drug in 18 year – [aducanumab](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/761178s000lbl.pdf) (Aduhelm™), a monthly (for 18 months) IV beta-amyloid IgG monoclonal antibody, [but](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/08/the-aducanumab-approval) [it](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/aduhelm-drug-alzheimers-cost-medicare/619169/) [doesn't](https://neurocentrix.com.au/controversy-approval-aduhelm-alzheimers/) [actually](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01546-2) [work](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12213) – it didn't show reduction in clinical decline, only reduction in beta-amyloid levels. Aduhelm was approved on biomarker endpoints, not primary efficacy endpoints; it's like targeting bilirubin to treat hepatitis.

    Their two stage 3 trials were halted early because of [futility](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778191?resultClick=1). They then did some post hoc analysis and found the first stage 3 trial's interim data on the high dose regimen showed a statistically significant difference of -22% in clinical decline derived from a difference of 0.39 on an 18-point score of cognitive and functional skills. Other cognitive test endpoints showed no difference e.g. MMSE difference was 0.6 points (not even the minimal clinically significant difference of 1). No statistically significant reduction in clinical decline in lower dose in that trial or any dose in the second stage 3 trial.

    10 out of 11 panellists on the FDA advisory panel ultimately voted that the presented data could not be considered as evidence of aducanumab’s effectiveness; the remaining panellist was uncertain. Then the FDA [approved](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-decision-approve-new-treatment-alzheimers-disease) [it](https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/29/biogen-fda-alzheimers-drug-approval-aduhelm-project-onyx/) [anyway](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/health/alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-fda.html), buying into the amyloid hypothesis although every single attempt to translate that into a beneficial clinical effect has failed – this [meta-analysis](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n156) combined results from 14 randomized controlled trials and found that reduction in amyloid levels alone is unlikely to substantially slow cognitive decline within the follow-up period of most typical trials. This shows regulatory inconsistency, and misdirects future pharma R&D towards a likely dead end. In [reversal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/health/aduhelm-alzheimers-fda.htm), the FDA now suggests that only those with mild memory or thinking problems should receive it.


    The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review [estimates](https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ICER_ALZ_Draft_Evidence_Report_050521.pdf) that a cost-effective price is $2,500–8,300 per year, and the [cost per QALY threshold](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-utility-analysis-health-economic-studies) by NICE for England and Wales is between £20,000 and £30,000. Aduhelm costs $56,000/year not counting the cost of routine PET scans to monitor the common (41% in treatment vs 10% in placebo!) side effects of cerebral edema/ sulcal effusions/ microhaemorrhages/ superficial siderosis, so who’s paying? The vast majority of US patients who take it will have Medicare coverage of some kind, so the cost will be largely borne by taxpayers, so the libertarian argument doesn’t apply because patients wouldn’t be taking Aduhelm _on their own nickel_. 

* [First polygenically-screened baby born](https://www.ivfbabble.com/on-the-40th-anniversary-of-the-first-ivf-in-the-usa-the-first-baby-elizabeth-jordan-carr-looks-at-how-science-today-has-produced-a-new-world-first-baby-aurea/), see also [Embryo Screening for Polygenic Disease Risk: Recent Advances and Ethical Considerations](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/12/8/1105/htm), Tellier at al 2021: New overview of state-of-the-art polygenic risk scores, precision genotyping of embryos, and genomic indices; and [Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Polygenic Disease Relative Risk Reduction: Evaluation of Genomic Index Performance in 11,883 Adult Sibling Pairs](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/11/6/648/htm), Treff et al. 2020:

* [Embryo Selection for Intelligence](https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-selection): Gwern estimates that with 10 embryos (a near-best-case scenario of what you're likely to get from egg extraction) and modern (as of 2016/2017) polygenic scoring technology, you could get on average +3 IQ points by implanting the smartest; if polygenic scoring technology reached the limits of its potential (might happen within a decade or two) you could get +9 IQ points
* Related: [The Algernon Argument][gwern] – any simple major enhancement to human intelligence is a net evolutionary disadvantage.

    Intelligence to us looks like an unalloyed good but just like everything in biology it's a trade off; there ain't no freed lunch and intelligence is subject to diminishing returns like every other thing; in effect all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can getting away with.

    Exhibit A: Ashkenazi jew theory of intelligence – the Ashkenazi were forced into occupations demanding intelligence, and micro-selected for high intelligence; the trade-off tho is that too much of the high IQ genes result in horrible diseases like Tay-Sachs⁠.

    Exhibit B: [a Scottish family](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740882/) had a unique mutation which was found to increase verbal IQ in afflicted family members vs non by something like 25 points, except that mutation starts causing blindness in their 20s.

* [CRISPR-Cas9 In Vivo Gene Editing for Transthyretin Amyloidosis](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107454), Gillmore et al. 2021: We really are finally on the cusp of a brave new CRISPR world of medical therapeutics (limited to a few rare germline genetic diseases will be amenable to in vivo gene-editing therapy via IV infusion like this one).
* [Efficacy of Wolbachia-Infected Mosquito Deployments for the Control of Dengue](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2030243), Utarini et al. 2021: Remember all the doomsaying about releasing engineered mosquitoes into the wild? Well the authors just released _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes infected with the _w_Mel strain of _Wolbachia pipientis_ (less susceptible than wild-type to dengue virus infection) in 24 geographic clusters, and found protective efficacies (n=8144) of 77.1% for symptomatic dengue and 86.2% for hospitalisation.
* "What’s with the [Hungarian](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/) [supergenius](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/29/four-nobel-truths/) [scientists](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/30/hungarian-education-iii-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-budapestians/)?" Drug discovery edition: [Tamas Bartfai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamas_Bartfai) co-created the first acellular pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine; co-created the “coolmouse” thus disproving the dogma that all mammals have a 36.7 °C core body temperature; co-discovered the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the brain which was thought to be only present in the periphery; and co-discovered the coexistence of classical transmitters and neuropeptides; directed the development of the first SSRI (zimelidine) for depression, the first proton pump inhibitor (omeprazol) for acid reflux, the COMT inhibitor (Tasmar-tolcapone) for Parkinson’s disease, the first benzodiazepine antagonist (flunitrazepam) for benzodiazepine overdose, and the first oral multiple sclerosis drug (sphingosine 1-phosphate).

* [Targeting the biology of ageing with mTOR inhibitors to improve immune function in older adults: phase 2b and phase 3 randomised trials](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(21)00062-3/fulltext), Mannick et al. 2021

Diagnostics:
* [Rapid Sequencing-Based Diagnosis of Thiamine Metabolism Dysfunction Syndrome](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100365), Owen et al. 2021: Brave new world of rapid sequencing-based diagnoses: the genome of an infant with encephalopathy was sequenced in just over 11 hours, which led to a clinical diagnosis of thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 2 (THMD2), informing the treatment of the child, without which would lead to infant death.
* [Common pitfalls and recommendations for using machine learning to detect and prognosticate for COVID-19 using chest radiographs and CT scans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00307-0), Roberts et al. 2021: all 400+ chest X-ray COVID detection ML algorithms published since COVID are found to be fatally flawed and thus have _zero_ clinical use.

    Problems include using a dataset consisting of _paediatric patients below the age of 5_ as the control, using duplicate datasets, implicit bias in the COVID positive x-ray scans, and the many blatant methodological errors include failures to reveal key details about the training and experimental data sets, not performing robustness or sensitivity analyses of their models, not performing any external validation, not showing any confidence intervals around the final results etc.

* [Accuracy of Practitioner Estimates of Probability of Diagnosis Before and After Testing](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2778364), Morgan et al. 2021: survey of 553 GP staff found widespread overestimates (by 2-10 times) of the probability of diseases; adjustment of estimates in face of test results ranged from accurate to yet more overestimation. Med schools need to teach pretest probability estimates! Teach the predictive values of patient history, examination, and investigations! Teach Bayesian clinical reasoning, and provide readily accessible references for clinical sensitivity and specificity, make pretest probability calculators for diseases other than cardiac ischemia!

Meta-medicine:

He could only be intubated after enough grain was removed from his mouth and pharynx using suction and forceps. It took the thoracic surgeons 4 hours to remove all visible grains by clapping on his chest and suction via bronchoscope. He had a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 501 mmHg, the highest ever reported (normally 38-42 mmHg). The boy made a full recovery and was discharged 10 days after admission.

#### Psychology

* Beginning in the late sixties, Helmut Kentler, one of the most influential sexologists in Germany, placed neglected boys in foster homes run by pedophiles. The ["Kentler experiment"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/26/the-german-experiment-that-placed-foster-children-with-pedophiles) was authorized and financially supported by the Berlin Senate. In a report submitted to the Senate, in 1988, Kentler had described it as a “complete success.”
* The Cape Town–Port Elizabeth Railway service officially employed [Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_(baboon)), a chacma baboon, as a signalman, and paid it twenty cents a day, and half a bottle of beer each week. It is widely reported that in his nine years of employment with the railway company, Jack never made a single mistake.

#### Miscellaneous

* One of the Seven Wonders of the World is canonically the best. Antipater of Sidon, who wrote the list used today, said when he laid eyes on the [Temple of Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis) at Ephesus, “Those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, ‘Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand.’” Artemis is the goddess of childbirth, and her temple was burned down the day Alexander the Great was born – legend has it that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander’s delivery to save her burning temple. Alexander must have felt guilty because he offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding when he conquered Ephesus. The Ephesians tactfully refused, saying "it would be improper for one god to build a temple to another" and eventually rebuilt it after Alexander’s death, at their own expense.
* In 1942, a British armed merchant ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of Brazil. As the ship was sinking, Chinese second stewart [Poon Lim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poon_Lim) took a life jacket and jumped overboard before the boilers exploded. When a large storm hit which spoiled his fish and fouled his water, Lim, barely alive, caught a bird and drank its blood to survive. When there was no rain, he caught a shark, clubbed it to death using water jugs, cut it open, and sucked the blood from its liver. He survived on his life raft for 133 days, a record still unbroken today.
