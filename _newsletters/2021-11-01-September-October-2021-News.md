This is the September and October 2021 issue of the SubCriticalAppraisal Newsletter ([archives](https://subcriticalappraisal.com/newsletters/)).

Programming note: as it is demotivating to play catch-up, I’ve elected to combine the two month’s worth of links in this issue so I can return to the regular schedule in November. This also means this issue is double the normal length. Enjoy.

Feel free to [email](mailto:subcriticalappraisal@gmail.com) me with any and all suggestions or feedback. Without further ado:

* Related, [the scaling hypothesis](https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis):

    When OpenAI released GPT-3 last year, it was the biggest NN every trained by an order of magnitude, and to the surprise of almost everyone, the vast increase in size did not run into diminishing or negative returns, and the improvements from GPT-2 were qualitatively distinct and even more surprising in showing meta-learning e.g. while GPT-2 learned how to do common natural language tasks like text summarisation, GPT-3 learned how to follow directions and learn new tasks from a few examples.


    So the scaling hypothesis regards the blessings of scale as the secret of AGI: intelligence is ‘just’ simple neural units and learning algorithms applied to diverse experiences at a (currently) unreachable scale, so NNs will get smarter just by dumping more computational resources.
