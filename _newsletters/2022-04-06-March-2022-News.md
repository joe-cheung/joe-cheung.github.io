#### Medicine

Therapeutics:
* [Synthetic introns enable splicing factor mutation-dependent targeting of cancer cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01224-2), North et al. 2022: exploiting many cancer’s change-of-function mutation affecting RNA splicing, synthetic introns enables mutation-dependent killing of _SF3B1_-mutant leukaemia, breast cancer, uveal melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells _in vitro_ while leaving wild-type cells unaffected
* [Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of concomitant administration of multiple doses of cagrilintide with semaglutide 2·4 mg for weight management: a randomised, controlled, phase 1b trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014067362100845X), Enebo et al. 2022: n=23 cagrilintide (long-acting amylin analogue) + semaglutide (GLP-1 analogue) vs n=24 placebo + semaglutide showed 6.0-7.4% additional weight loss

Diagnostics:
* [Time to Retire the Concept of Transient Ischemic Attack](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2789150), Easton et al. 2022: TIAs defined as ‘brief episodes of brain ischemia occurring rapidly enough to cause only transient symptoms and no permanent brain injury’ do not exist; all symptomatic focal cerebral ischemic events should be considered to be cerebral infarctions (it’s only a matter of degree), so TIAs are in fact mior ischemic strokes, and should be called _acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome_

Meta-medicine:
* [Do Higher-Priced Hospitals Deliver Higher-Quality Care?](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29809#fromrss), Cooper et al. 2022: receiving care from hospitals with two standard deviations higher inpatient prices leads to a 35% reduction in in-hospital mortality, or an additional $1 million on nondeferrable emergency cases for each life saved i.e. likely cost-effective, only if market is unconcentrated and no effect in concentrated markets; regulating hospital prices in unconcentrated markets may lead to a reduction in quality
* [Are Medical Care Prices Still Declining? A Re-Examination Based on Cost‐Effectiveness Studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA17635), Dunn et al. 2022: contra official statistics of 0.52% increase per year in medical care prices relative to economy-wide inflation from 2000 to 2017, quality-adjusted medical care prices actually declined by 1.33% per year

Epidemiology/pathophysiology:
* [Prevention of MS Requires Intervention on the Causes of the Disease: Reconciling Genes, Epigenetics, and Epstein Barr Virus](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.817677/full), Kearns et al. 2022: MS is 100% caused by genes _and_ environment; due to EBV’s near ubiquity, the higher heritability in higher incidence populations reflects _higher_ burden of environmental exposures (when everyone has a gun, knowing that the gun is the mechanistic cause of gun violence doesn’t explain the variation, rather it is explained by modifiable environmental factors ubiquitous in one population vs another)
* [Continuous manipulation of mental representations is compromised in cerebellar degeneration](https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awac072/6535860?login=true), McDougle et al. 2022: ; (n=48 cerebellar disorder [CD] vs n=49 control) CD group showed impaired mental shape rotation and multiplication (arithmetic requiring memory retrieval) but unimpaired visual working memory and addition (arithmetic requiring iterative manipulation of number line); as with motor control, the cerebellum may be essential for coordinating dynamic movement-like transformations in a mental workspace
* [The p Factor: One General Psychopathology Factor in the Structure of Psychiatric Disorders?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209412/), Gaspi et al. 2015: comorbidity rates are very high in psychiatry and conform roughly to the rule of 50% (half of patients who meet diagnostic criteria for one disorder meet that of a second disorder etc.); mental disorders have three dimensions: an Internalising liability to depression and anxiety; an Externalising liability to antisocial and substance-use disorders; and a Thought Disorder liability to symptoms of psychosis; underlying all three dimensions is the _p _factor:

    ![](/images/2022-04-06-March-2022-News/image4.png)
    _If _p_ is normally distributed (as you would expect from polygenic or even omnigenic traits), binary diagnosis of mental disorders e.g. Schizophrenia may become obsolete_

* [SARS-CoV-2 is associated with changes in brain structure in UK Biobank](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5), Douaud et al. 2022: (n=401 covid positive vs n=384 control) (i) greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue-contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, (ii) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions functionally-connected to the primary olfactory cortex, and (iii) greater reduction in global brain size
* [Risk of Hospitalization, severe disease, and mortality due to COVID-19 and PIMS-TS in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.30.21267048v1), Sorg et al. 2022: overall hospitalisation rate 35.9 per 10,000 children, ICU admission rate 1.7 per 10,000; case fatality 0.09 per 10,000; in children aged 5-11 ICU admission rate 0.2 per 10,000

#### Biology

Genetics:
* [Assessing the contribution of rare variants to complex trait heritability from whole-genome sequence data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00997-7), Wainschtein et al. 2022: estimated heritability of height increases from 0.53 to 0.68 and BMI from 0.18 to 0.3 when factoring in genomic relatedness matrices (GRMs) of minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of at least 0.01%, but still lower than estimates from twin studies (0.7-0.9 for height; 0.5-0.9 for BMI), which suggests the remaining missing heritability of complex traits and disease is found in variants with MAF &lt;0.01%, which is consistent with [negative selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_selection_(natural_selection))
* [Genome-wide meta-analysis of alcohol use disorder in East Asians](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01265-w), Zhou et al. 2022: largest-to-date in East Asians (n=13,600) confirmed the usual _ADH1B_ and _ALDH2_ loci (ethanol metabolism) but no novel risk loci was observed
* [The genetics of specific cognitive abilities](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.05.479237v1), Procopio et al. 2022: (n=860,000) compared to _g_ variance (.5 heritability) variance of 16 special cognitive abilities (e.g. fluid reasoning, processing speed, and quantitative knowledge) has heritability of .55 on average (.49 when corrected for _g_) but some abilities are more heritable than others (e.g. 40% for decision speed; 74% for processing speed) and unlike _g_ doesn’t show dramatic increase with age
* [A weakly structured stem for human origins in Africa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.23.485528v1), Ragsdale et al. 2022 
* [Reduced reproductive success is associated with selective constraint on human genes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04549-9)  Gardner et al. 2022

Neuroscience:
* [Reproducible brain-wide association studies require thousands of individuals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04492-9), Marek et al. 2022: median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25, so unsurprisingly effect size is routinely inflated; reproduction rate improves as sample sizes grow into the thousands, noting that BWAS should be able to achieve reproducibility in relatively smaller samples than GWAS because of bigger effect sizes
* [Decoding cognition from spontaneous neural activity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00570-z), Liu et al. 2022: “representation-rich” approach (decoding task-related representations form spontaneous neural activity) combines the pros of both the “data-driven” approach (spontaneous but hard to establish causation) and the “intervention-based” approach (allows direct interference but disrupts spontaneity)
* [Independence in ROI analysis: where is the voodoo?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686233/), Poldrack et al. 2009: on the fMRI [voodoo](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26158964/) controversy — Vye _et al._ were correct that non-independent region of interest (ROI) analyses result in bias ([Bennet et al. 2009](https://teenspecies.github.io/pdfs/NeuralCorrelates.pdf) scanned a dead salmon’s brain using an uncorrected threshold of P &lt; 0.001 and 2-voxel extent threshold without strict control for multiple comparison, not uncommon methodology, to find ‘active’ brain area when ‘asked’ to perform an emotional judgement task), but incorrect in their suggestion that correlations between behaviour and imaging data in the 0.7–0.8 range are ‘impossibly high’
* [An action potential initiation mechanism in distal axons for the control of dopamine release](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn0532#.Yj2XhqOvsYQ.twitter), Liu et al. 2022

* [Scaling laws in enzyme function reveal a new kind of biochemical universality](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2106655119), Gagler et al. 2022: genomic dataset from 12,000 metagenomes, 1,300 archaea, 12,000 bacteria, and 200 eukaryotic taxa show that all enzyme classes (EC) display scaling behaviour with positive exponents (k > 0) with the power law fit _y = ax<sup>k</sup>_, such that the total number of unique functions in each EC systematically increases with an expanding total number of enzyme function, suggesting the possibility of universal constraints (not strictly dependent on evolutionary contingency) on biochemical architecture:

    ![](/images/2022-04-06-March-2022-News/image8.png)

    _The last universal common ancestor shares the same scaling law, but perhaps even at the origin of life and alien life._

* [Precision of morphogen gradients in neural tube development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28834-3), Vetter et al. 2022: single morphogen (encodes positional information during embryogenesis) gradient yields higher central progenitor domain boundaries accuracy than simultaneous readout of opposing gradients; position error of gradients in mouse neural tube has been overestimated

Miscellaneous: 
* [Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.05.475088v1), Obaldia et al. 2022: odour concentration from carboxylic acid is the primary factor in attractiveness 
* [Levantine overkill: 1.5 million years of hunting down the body size distribution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379121005230), Dembitzer et al. 2022: mean hunted animal masses declined log-linearly in 10k years ago to only 1.7% of those 1.5 million years ago independent of climate change, suggesting that humans hunted the largest species until extinction and moved onto the next largest species

#### Physics/Computer Science

* [Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466), Yang et al. 2022: outperforming GPT-3 model with tuning cost only 7% of total pre-training cost

#### Statistics/Meta-Science

* [An Investigation of the Facts Behind Columbia's U.S. News Ranking](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/ranking/investigation.html), Thaddeus 2022: putting his tenure to good use, the Columbia maths prof finds his college’s rise in rankings from 18th place to 2nd place is based on fraudulent data mainly by deflating class sizes, inflating instructional spending, and inflating the proportion of professors with PhDs
* [Sci-Hub downloads per country](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00556-y) again:

    ![](/images/2022-04-06-March-2022-News/image2.png)

    _Even US researchers who have paid access to journals use Sci-Hub just because its faster._

#### Psychology

* [Ex Post Lobbying](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/692473?journalCode=jop), You 2017: 40% of lobbying happens after the bill’s passage (ex post) and 50% of ex post lobbying targets members of Congress suggests collective action problem in lobbying — the more ex ante (before bill’s passage) lobbying the higher the collective benefits, the less specific the implementation the more ex post lobbying is required be a firm to secure the benefit; nonprofit advocacy groups and schools/colleges engage in more ex ante lobbying while agribusiness and energy/natural resources show higher ex post lobbying ratios; the bigger the firm the more balanced resource allocation between ex ante and ex post lobbying is but biassed towards ex ante; trade association engage in more ex ante lobbying than individual groups
* [Richer (and Holier) Than Thou? The Effect of Relative Income Improvements on Demand for Redistribution](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/99/2/201/58387/Richer-and-Holier-Than-Thou-The-Effect-of-Relative?redirectedFrom=fulltext), Karadja et al. 2017: people prefer redistribution less when they realise they are relatively richer than they thought they were

    ![](/images/2022-04-06-March-2022-News/image7.png)

    _70% of Swedes believe they are poorer than other Swedes than they actually are (underestimate by more than 10%)_

#### Technology

* [Technical reasoning bolsters cumulative technological culture through convergent transformations](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl7446), Osiurak, 2022: technology evolved through accumulated modifications transmitted not by blind copying as current theories propose, but instead by technical reasoning as a reconstruction mechanism that allows recovery from partial information obtained through social learning, thus guaranteeing the high-fidelity transmission of advantageous technologies

#### Economics/Business/Finance

* [The Quality and Efficiency of Public and Private Firms: Evidence from Ambulance Services](https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qje/qjac014/6536944?login=true), Knutsson et al. 2022: Swedish private ambulances reduce costs and perform better than public ones (patients ~randomly assigned) on contracted measures such as response time, but perform worse on noncontracted measures such as mortality (1.4% higher risk of death within 3 years) by cutting costs at the expense of ambulance staff quality
* [Drink...then Drive Away: The Effects of Lowering the BAC in Utah](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4058682), Portillo et al. 2022: lowering legal blood alcohol content for driving from 0.08 to 0.05 g/dL in Utah resulted in a fall of 0.674 accidents per 1000 residents in urban counties (mostly property damage, some fatalities, not injury) most significantly on weekdays
* [Let's Take the Con Out of Randomized Control Trials in Development: The Puzzles and Paradoxes of External Validity, Empirically Illustrated](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/publications/faculty-working-papers/lets-take-con-out-of-randomized-control-trials), Pritchet et al. 2021: RCTs can’t be crucial to development because many countries became highly developed RCTs they mattered; the highest observed economic growth in human history (the East Asian economic miracle) happened before RCTs became fashionable; past RCTs have little influence of policy; practitioner objections about external validity that are technically right about the unreliability of RCTs for making context-specific predictions while academics are wrong, and this in the technical domain that supposedly is the academicians comparative advantage
* [Accounting for the Great Divergence: Recent findings from historical national accounting](https://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=15936), Broadberry 2021: there was a European Little Divergence as Britain and the Netherlands overtook Italy and Spain, and an Asian Little Divergence as Japan overtook China and India; the Great Divergence occurred because Japan grew more slowly than Britain and the Netherlands starting from a lower level, and because of a strong negative growth trend in Qing dynasty China:

* [The Perils of Partial Attribution: Let's All Play for Team Development](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/perils-partial-attribution), Pritchet 2017: ‘rigorous, evidence-based’ developmental economics inevitable leads donors and external development actors to focus on individual actions that produce at best mere millions but for which they can receive credit (like Wilt Chamberlain), rather than more indirect systemic actions that produce billions but can only receive partial credit (like Bill Russel)

#### Philosophy/EA

* [Dual use of artificial-intelligence-powered drug discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9), Urbina et al. 2022: as a proof of concept, a machine learning model predicting new therapeutic inhibitors was driven towards the nerve agent VX (6-10mg is fatal), in less than 6 hours designed VX and 40,000 other molecules that are even more toxic than VX
* [“Taste typicality” is a foundational and multi-modal dimension of ordinary aesthetic experience](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00261-5), Chen et al. 2022: (n=100 + n=100 replication) the more typical one’s taste was for visual stimuli, the more typical one’s taste was for environmental sounds; taste typicality was the primary way people’s aesthetic preferences differed from each other, with no other factor explaining even one fourth as much variance
