This is the November and December 2021 issue of the SubCriticalAppraisal Newsletter ([archives](https://subcriticalappraisal.com/newsletters/)). I’ve been busy in the past two months, so you’re getting the two issues as one.

The purpose of this newsletter is to be a more meaningful and summarised version of the [RSS feed](https://subcriticalappraisal.com/feed.xml), complete with all my writings, site updates, interesting links, and reviews each month.

Feel free to [email](mailto:subcriticalappraisal@gmail.com) me with any and all suggestions or feedback. Happy new year!
