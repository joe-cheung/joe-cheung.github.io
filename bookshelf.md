Buying books and reading books are completely unrelated hobbies. Now that I have done the hoarding for you, you can focus on the latter.

I always enjoy reading others' lists and browsing their bookshelves, but I’ve always found it odd when people see my collection and say “What a lot of books! Have you read all of them?” Behold my (non-exhaustive) [antilibrary](https://books.google.com/books?id=_ntDTaMUys8C&lpg=PT115&ots=E3jhWnG6aB&pg=PT124#v=onepage&q&f=false) that would make Umberto Eco proud. All of them are worth reading, though as always it's kinda hard to recommend books in the abstract.

Drop me an [email](mailto:subcriticalappraisal@gmail.com) if you’ve got recommendations! Always appreciated.
