#COVID-19 Vaccines: Much More Than You Wanted To Know

## I. Overview

Pfizer and BioNTech just concluded their phase 3 analysis of their messenger RNA (mRNA) candidate and reports it to be 95% effective, with 162 infection cases in the placebo group versus 8 in the vaccine group in the 43000-patient trial. The vaccine is well tolerated and there are minimal severe side-effects (a.k.a. grade 3 adverse events) including fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2.0%). It will require 2 doses 21 days apart and cannot be removed from -70°C more than 4 times, which poses a massive distribution challenge. Nonetheless, it is fantastic news.

Moderna reports in their first interim analysis of their phase 3 trial that their own mRNA candidate is 94.5% effective, with 90 infection cases in the placebo group versus 5 cases in the vaccine group in the 30000-patient trial. The vaccine is generally well tolerated, with short-lived grade 3 adverse events such as fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), and pain (4.1%). It will also require 2 doses, 4 weeks apart. Most groundbreaking is that their vaccine remains stable up to 6 months under standard freezer condition (-20°C), up to 30 days under normal fridge condition (4°C), and up to 12 hours in room temperature, which means significantly easier distribution and storage with the existing infrastructure.

The Oxford viral vector<sup>1</sup> (weakened chimpanzee adenovirus modified to express the spike protein) vaccine was in the lead before its trials were briefly suspended when two patients got ill. Interim analysis of the data from its phase 2/3 trial and a parallel phase 3 trial found one dosing regimen (n=2,741) to show efficacy of 90% when the vaccine was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. I have no idea why a first full dose has lower efficacy than a first half dose. There is no information on side effects, but there are hospitalisations or severe infection cases in participants. The vaccine can be stored and transported at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 °C) for at least six months.

Meanwhile in Russia (with the usual caveats), the Sputnik V viral vector (modified human adenovirus) vaccine has shown 92% effectiveness in its 40000-patient phase 3 trial.

[<span class="underline">The first interim data analysis of the Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19 phase III clinical</span>](https://sputnikvaccine.com/newsroom/pressreleases/the-first-interim-data-analysis-of-the-sputnik-v-vaccine-against-covid-19-phase-iii-clinical-trials-/)

The Chinese Sinovac Biotech vaccine was reported to elicit quick immune response and is at least found to be safe in its Brazil trial. There has yet to be any published data from its phase 2 and 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates, but that has not stopped a reported 60000 people to receive it in emergency-authorised use, including the Chinese military and to some employees of Chinese state-owned enterprises. China has a safe vaccine, just not for you\!

It is important to note that these results were only published in bare-bones press releases, and there is no information about whether asymptomatic infection is also protected, nor whether severity of symptoms is reduced. On the other hand, all other candidates, including around 10 currently in phase 3 trials, are designed to block SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, so it is quite likely that the aforementioned candidates will not be the only ones that prove efficacious. The expected value of delaying getting sick just went way up\! So stay home and stay safe.

We will only find out how long immunity from the vaccines will last by waiting and watching, and the pandemic is just barely a year old so we do not have long term data on natural immune response. That said, a paper found that memory B cells specific to spike protein (virus-specific protein that gives it the crown-like appearance) were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month, while SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months. Another paper found that IgA and IgM antibodies were short-lived (seronegative by 51 and 47 days post-symptoms), while IgG antibodies lasted longer (at least 75 days post-symptoms). Yet another paper found that functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are retained for at least six months. The literature paints a consistent picture of a strong, normal, lasting immune response in the vast majority of patients. Also, early vaccine data suggests antibody responses at least as strong as those found in naturally infected cases. Hence, there is (so far) every reason to think that vaccine-based immunity will be as good or better than that conferred by an actual infection.

With regards to viral mutation, a Pfizer paper found that many of the common mutations are as susceptible to antibodies raised by their vaccine. Also, SARS-COV-2 does not have the re-assortment mechanism that allows influenza virus to change so easily and quickly that warrants annual vaccination. There is an effort to monitor developing mutations so that such issues can be dealt with swiftly.

Another worry is efficacy in different demographics, but fortunately the Pfizer vaccine demonstrated 94% efficacy in patients 65 and older. Pfizer also claims that 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. However, there are no numbers yet for people with pre-existing conditions and risk factors.

## II. The story of the mRNA

While there are about 200 candidates globally, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the only ones that rely on mRNA, a completely novel technology that was a scientific backwater before it was a multibillion-dollar idea.

[<span class="underline">STAT's Covid-19 Drugs and Vaccines Tracker</span>](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/drugs-vaccines-tracker/)

[<span class="underline">COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker dot org</span>](https://www.covid-19vaccinetracker.org/)

[<span class="underline">COVID-19 Vaccine and Therapeutic Drugs Tracker</span>](https://biorender.com/covid-vaccine-tracker?utm_campaign=Vaccine+Tracker%3A+Announce&utm_content=COVID-19+Vaccine+Tracker%3A+Announcement&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io)

The concept of mRNA therapeutics was first demonstrated to work in mice in 1990, but even though it is easier and quicker to manufacture, not to mention safer, compared to traditional DNA and protein based therapeutics, no mRNA vaccine nor drug has ever been approved. mRNA is notoriously unstable as free RNA breaks down quickly, posing a significant *in vivo* (in live cell) delivery challenge. mRNA injected into the body might also elicit unintended immune response, which is the stumbling block that has led to most of the rejections of grant applications for its research.

[<span class="underline">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</span>](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243)

For Katalin Karikó, the Hungarian-born biochemist, mRNA was a career dead-end. Her grant applications were all rejected, and she was even demoted from her path to full professorship. But after a decade of trial and error with collaborator Drew Weisman, an immunology MD, PhD, they discovered in 2005 that by modifying a nucleoside (building block of mRNA), mRNA can penetrate its target cells without eliciting an immune response. This key discovery did not go unnoticed by the future founders of Moderna and BioNTech.

[<span class="underline">Incorporation of Pseudouridine Into mRNA Yields Superior Nonimmunogenic Vector With Increased Translational Capacity and Biological Stability</span>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775451/)

Derrick Rossi was a Canadian stem cell biology postdoctoral fellow at Stanford when he first came across Karikó and Weisman’s work . With another postdoctoral fellow, they discovered that modified mRNA can reprogram adult cells to act like embryonic stem cells that have the potential to develop into any cell. Embryonic stem cells are the holy grail of regenerative medicine, and Rossi's discovery can completely sidestep the ethical controversy of harvesting them from discarded embryos.

[<span class="underline">Reprogramming human fibroblasts to pluripotency using modified mRNA</span>](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23429718/)

Rossi, who is now a professor at Harvard Medical School, informed his colleague and biotech entrepreneur Timothy Springer, and the two contacted Robert Langer, a prolific inventor and legendary biochemical engineering professor at MIT. Rossi then presented his findings to Noubar Afeyan, founder of Flagship Ventures. Within a several months, Rossi, Langer, Afeyan, and another physician-researcher found Moderna<sup>2</sup>, a pun on modified RNA.

In Germany, husband and wife Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci, both Turkish immigrant and immunology physicians-scientists, co-founded BioNTech as a spin-off of another biotech startup they previously co-founded. Like Moderna, BioNTech licensed technology developed by Karikó and Weissman. In fact, BioNTech hired Karikó in 2013. When Şahin read about the COVID-19 in China in January, he realised BioNTech required a strong partner to manufacture the vaccine and reached out to the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which BioNTech worked with before to try to develop mRNA influenza vaccines.

## III. mRNA technology

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines demonstrate the coming of age of nano-medicine. One of the major advantages of mRNA vaccines is that they are cheaper and faster to manufacture, because they are chemically manufactured using readily available materials in the lab from DNA templates that scales easily, compared to conventional vaccines that rely on cell culture in chicken eggs or mammalian cells.

[<span class="underline">Nanomedicine comes of age with mRNA vaccines – Soft Machines</span>](http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=2541)

Conventional vaccines usually contain inactivated pathogen (the disease-causing organism) or antigen (pathogen-specific protein), which stimulates the body's immune system to develop antibodies, priming it for a faster and more effective response when exposed to the actual pathogen in the future.

Human cells use DNA as the template to make mRNA, which are translated to build proteins. RNA vaccines contain synthetic mRNA strand that codes for an antigen specific to the pathogen, which makes the host cell produce and display the antigen on its surface, where it is recognised by the immune system to produce antibodies.

[<span class="underline">RNA vaccines: an introduction</span>](https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines)

The details of mRNA technologies used by Moderna and BioNTech are undoubtedly proprietary (which accounts for the difference in storage temperatures), but they have to overcome the same obstacle: even before mRNA reaches its target cells, the body is very effective in identifying them as foreign and destroying them. The two companies’ solutions are more or less the same: wrap up the vulnerable mRNA strand in a nanoscale shell made of two layers of phospholipid analogous to that found in cell membranes, and add to that cholesterol which makes the bilayer more stable and less permeable. Add to the shell a lipid attaching a short chain of water-soluble polymer, which gives the nanoparticle a hairy coat to repel immune cells. Then add a tertiary amine head group that is an ionisable lipid (a weak base like ammonia) that can accept a proton to become positively charged, hence the charge of the nanoparticle depends on the pH of the environment.

[<span class="underline">Expression kinetics of nucleoside-modified mRNA delivered in lipid nanoparticles to mice by various routes</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365915300535?via%3Dihub)

By dissolving the four components of the shell in ethanol, and the mRNA strand in a mildly acidic solution, the nanoparticle will self-assemble. The ionisable lipid becomes positively charged when it contacts the acid, and since the RNA is negatively charged, the two start to bond. Other lipids self-organise into a bilayer sphere with hydrophilic heads on the outside, and hydrophobic tails on the inside, encapsulating the RNA inside. When the nanoparticle comes into contact with the human cell membrane, a negatively charged lipid on the membrane binds to the positively charged heads of the ionisable lipids in the nanoparticle, allowing entry of the mRNA strand into the cell.

[<span class="underline">Optimization of Lipid Nanoparticle Formulations for mRNA Delivery in Vivo with Fractional Factorial and Definitive Screening Designs</span>](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b02497)

This breakthrough in mRNA technology represents decades of hard work that had not been primarily aimed for infectious disease vaccines. More recently, research has been driven by the field of cancer immunotherapy, for which BioNTech's Şahin received substantial funding from the European Research Council. Translational medical research is hard and can take unexpected turns. It is frankly amazing how fast the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were developed.

## IV. Genome sequencing

One of the key factors in rapid vaccine development is genome sequencing, which almost all vaccines rely on. The pace of innovation in genome sequencing in the last decade has been astonishing. The plummet in the cost of human whole genome sequencing (WGS) has even outpaced the Carlson curve<sup>3</sup>, which predicts that the doubling of DNA sequencing technologies as measured by cost<sup>4</sup> and performance would be at least as fast as Moore's law.

[<span class="underline">The Cost of Sequencing a Human Genome</span>](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost)

![](COVID-19_Vaccines//media/image4.png)

[<span class="underline">Opinionome: Can DNA sequencing get any faster and cheaper?</span>](https://www.broadinstitute.org/blog/opinionome-can-dna-sequencing-get-any-faster-and-cheaper)

It took $5 billion (adjusted for inflation) and almost 15 years for the Human Genome Project to sequence the first human genome. In 2016, Veritas Genetics began selling WGS for $999, breaking the commonly-referred commercial target of $1000. Last year, Veritas Genetics cut the cost for WGS to $599. In February this year, since acquiring US's Complete Genomics, China's BGI<sup>5</sup> claimed it could perform WGS for $100, which is the current commercial target.

[<span class="underline">China’s BGI says it can sequence a genome for just $100</span>](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/26/905658/china-bgi-100-dollar-genome/)

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus. Positive-sense (5′-to-3′) means that the viral genome itself acts as mRNA that is directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes into viral proteins, while negative-sense (3′-to-5′) means that it must be transcribed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) into a positive-sense mRNA, before being translated by the host cell's ribosomes into viral proteins. And since human cells do not contain RdRP, positive-sense ssRNA virus will tell the host cell to make RdRP first in order to replicate the rest of its genome, while negative-sense ssRNA virus is packaged with RdRP in the virion to first transcribe its genome into mRNA. In Cambridge, virus samples arrive the day after being taken, and are attached to an anonymised barcode. Once the sample is prepped, it gets pipetted into the injection port of the latest handheld minION sequencer, which can sequence the genomes of between 24 and 70 virus samples a day<sup>6</sup>.

[<span class="underline">The sequencing of COVID-19</span>](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/sequencingcovid)

Tracking SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and sharing genome data<sup>7</sup> globally is key in monitoring the pandemic. If a COVID ward has multiple samples of the same lineage, there might be a local outbreak within a particular area, community or perhaps even hospital.

## V. Development

After sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome, Pfizer, Moderna and all the other biotechs could begin to develop vaccines<sup>7</sup> and run clinical trials, which can normally take decades without any guarantee of success.

If you are a clinical trial doctor, you normally spend most of your time submitting funding requests, resubmitting them, waiting, then submitting them somewhere. When money finally starts coming in, the company might have changed its focus. Then you have to renegotiate and wait for ethics approval. It is inevitable that there are problems with patient recruitment. Pile on more regulatory issues, and when you eventually get to the end of all of this you might have a therapy. At that point the company may not have deemed the therapeutic to be profitable, or NICE thinks it just is not worth paying for. Even after a therapeutic hits the market, it can be forced to withdraw<sup>9</sup>.

To develop a new vaccine, a highly variable amount of time is needed to find a candidate that will get past the clinical trials, and another 6.3 years are necessary to get past clinical trials and registration. After passing clinical trials, it takes about 5-10 years to scale and distribute the vaccine. Even only looking at a vaccine candidate that is successful at every stage, it takes an average of ten years to develop from preclinical stages to launch, and an average of 7.6 years to go from Phase I to launch. Only 22% of developed vaccines are successful from start to finish, which means that 4.5 vaccine candidates are needed on average to produce a vaccine that works.

![](COVID-19_Vaccines//media/image3.png)

[<span class="underline">Vaccination from Our World In Data</span>](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination)

Looking back at the 27 most notable vaccines<sup>10</sup>, it gives a mean of 31.8 years of development, with a median of 27 years and a standard deviation of 17.7 years. If you exclude the vaccines still under development (e.g. HIV, malaria), the mean is 29.5 years (median 26, SD 17.4).

[<span class="underline">How long does it take to research and develop a new vaccine? - EA Forum</span>](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8qMDseJTE3vCFiYec/how-long-does-it-take-to-research-and-develop-a-new-vaccine)

Unfortunately there are no vaccines for a number of pathogens despite decades of research. HIV, for instance, causes a chronic infection and integrates itself into people’s genomes, and there is no natural immune response that eliminates the virus that a vaccine can mimic. HIV also mutates much faster than coronaviruses, making it much more difficult to rally a lasting immunity.

There are also no vaccines (which is about to change\!) to prevent human coronavirus infections and treatment is only supportive, even for the common cold, SARS-CoV-1 responsible for the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, or MERS-CoV responsible for the ongoing MERS outbreak that started in 2012. One reason is the lack of funding: take MERS for instance, once the regional epidemic has been controlled, it meant demand for a vaccine stayed low. Another reason is that vaccines have bad business models: they require massive R\&D budgets from preclinical studies all the way to completing the clinical trials, and if the vaccine provides long-lasting immunity, the companies can only sell so few vials. It is also just plain hard because it is difficult to tell what immune responses to coronaviruses are pathologic rather than protective, and there is a huge number of strains that mutate very rapidly (e.g. common cold). Vaccines are available for coronaviruses in chicken, pigs, and dogs, although their effectiveness is limited due to rapid mutation. In the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, entire herds of farm animals are destroyed.

[<span class="underline">Lessons for COVID-19 Immunity from Other Coronavirus Infections</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320303125)

It is all the more amazing that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and 200 other candidates have been developed so rapidly. A key reason is that many of the teams have previously worked on vaccines for the original SARS virus as well as MERS. Less than 10 weeks after the Chinese scientists published the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, Moderna already had a candidate ready for a phase 1 trial.

In the US, Operation Warp Speed (OWS) was established with the goal of producing and delivering 300 million vaccine doses by January 2021. OWS purchased vaccines before clinical trials have been completed e.g. $1.6 billion for 100 million doses from Novavax, and $1.95 billion for 100 million doses from Pfizer. Funding agencies also directly invest in vaccine development. Governments and foundations like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations are throwing millions, even billions into the hunt for vaccines. Moderna<sup>11</sup>, for instance,received $472 million from BARDA in July, on top of the $483 million it got in April.

During the 2014-2016 West African Ebola crisis (the worst Ebola outbreak in history), regulatory bodies embraced a new dexterity in green-lighting trials and were a lot more proactive in communicating with companies about the efficacy thresholds. For COVID-19, the FDA has outlined that vaccines need to prevent infections or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in just 50% of recipients to be approved. Some of the trials have even been collapsed into Phase 1/2 or Phase 2/3 trials, which can shave weeks or even months off the trials. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK has been conducting "rolling reviews" of the safety, manufacturing standards and effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine.

## VI. Manufacturing

Even when the vaccines pass phase 3 trials, manufacturing is a long and arduous process<sup>12</sup> with a myriad of stringent quality control measures at every step in the pipeline<sup>13</sup>. Not to mention the fact that all the later-stage candidates are based on completely novel or immature technologies that have never been scaled.

For the Oxford and Sputnik V vaccines, which are modified adenoviruses, the only therapeutic that uses a similar technology is gene therapy, which has only been used on single-digit thousands of patients (the Ebola vaccine is also a viral vector but it uses the VZV virus). Luckily, the UK already has four million doses of the vaccine ready to deploy as production has begun long before data from the Oxford phase 3 trials were analysed.

[<span class="underline">Adenovirus-mediated gene delivery: Potential applications for gene and cell-based therapies in the new era of personalized medicine</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352304217300272)

[<span class="underline">Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly?</span>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55041371)

Although the mRNA vaccines are the most advanced candidates they ironically have the least developed supply chain. Pfizer claims to eventually have enough capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021, which sounds like a lot but the vaccine requires 2 doses to work (and so do most if not all of the candidates). We need to vaccinate billions. It also does not help that Moderna will be calling the same suppliers for the raw materials.

[<span class="underline">Pfizer and BioNTech Announce Vaccine Candidate Against COVID-19 Achieved Success in First Interim Analysis from Phase 3 Study</span>](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against)

Vaccine supply chains contain some unusual supply links. Endotoxins shed by bacteria are one source of contamination, and to detect them, each batch of vaccine is tested with Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL), of which the only natural source is horseshoe crab blood. Luckily, a synthetic version of LAL has recently been developed and approved by the FDA and the European health ministry, but scaling its production is still going to be challenging.

Many Covid-19 candidates require adjuvants e.g. QS-21, which in theory can shrink the volume of vaccine needed in each dose, easing the pressure on manufacturers. The active ingredient in QS-21 comes from the soapbark tree that grows in the mountains of Chile. Its bark has to be harvested in the southern summer, turned into a slurry, and processed. A synthetic QS-21 made from fermenting raw sugarcane in Brazil is still in development. Squalene, another new adjuvant, is derived from shark liver oil. To obtain 1 billion doses would take a lot of sharks, a lot of hunting, and a lot of pissing off GreenPeace.

As mentioned before, mRNA degradation has to be prevented, and that requires a very rare substance called vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE). Just over 10 pounds of VCE is enough to produce 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine, but the current manufacturing processes require so much bioreactor capacity that it would cost $1.4 billion. More important, global bioreactor capacity cannot support production at that level while also producing other vaccines and cancer-fighting drugs.

Less exotic supply links such as needles and syringes will also be challenging to scale. The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has invested heavily in a number of companies to make up for lost time. Schott AG, the world’s largest manufacturer of medical borosilicate, a special glass to make vaccine vials that can withstand the -80°C storage, will produce 2 billion vials following a $376 million investment. Corning Inc. received $204 million to expand its production of glass vials. ApiJect Systems Corp. has received $138 million to make 100 million pre-fillable plastic syringes by the end of the year. SiO2 Materials Science has received $143 million to produce 120 million patented vials made of plastic coated with a thin layer of glass, which will not be affected by a potential sand shortage.

It is not clear what the rate-limiting step(s) is in scaling up the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines immediately. Oddly, none of the official sources say what makes the scaling take months instead of weeks or years, even when many governments and Bill Gates are spending more than a billion dollars to accelerate it<sup>14</sup>. We have already seen the costs of supply-chain failures in the delayed production of simple nasal swabs that slowed testing by months even as cases exploded worldwide. Securing and scaling supply chains for the vaccines is paramount in the race against time.

[<span class="underline">A Coronavirus Vaccine Requires Medical Essentials Like Vials and Needles</span>](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-covid-vaccine-manufacturing-essentials/)

## VII. Distribution

On top of manufacturing, distribution is going to be a tremendous logistical challenge, especially for the Pfizer vaccine that cannot be removed from -70°C more than 4 times. “Cold chain” delivery is hard enough for first-world cities, but to reach people living in rural parts of India, or sub-Saharan Africa, it will need new infrastructure.

Pfizer has designed a special box, the size of a large cooler, that can hold a few hundred vials, each containing 10-20 doses of vaccine. The boxes are equipped with GPS-enabled thermal sensors, but are not supposed to be opened more than twice a day and need to be closed within one minute of opening. Once it has thawed, the vaccine can be refrigerated for five days.

UPS said it was constructing a "freezer farm" with 70 industrial freezers each capable of holding 48,000 vials in Kentucky. FedEx is also adding freezers that can maintain temperatures as low as -80°C in cities such as Memphis, Indianapolis and Paris. It is also installing additional refrigerated trailers in Oakland, Dallas and Los Angeles, which could be used for vaccines that need to be served chilled, not frozen.

All this freezing means the world is facing a looming shortage of dry ice, yet another unexpected side effect of the pandemic. Dry ice (made from carbon dioxide) is most commonly created as a byproduct during ethanol production, which declined as the demand for gasoline slumped during lockdowns.

[<span class="underline">How to Ship a Vaccine at –80°C, and Other Obstacles in the Covid Fight</span>](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/business/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-cold-frozen-logistics.html)

Then there is the problem of who will get the vaccine first. Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) enables the staged entry of a vaccine, first for people at high risk e.g. health-care providers, first responders, the elderly, and those with high-risk comorbidities. Up next would be K-12 teachers, and critical workers in high-risk settings like public transit. The third phase includes young adults and children and other workers at increased risk, followed by everyone else in phase four.

\[UPDATE 21/11/2020\] The NHS plans to vaccinate all priority cohorts by the end of February, and England’s population by end of April. Its many assumptions include 75% uptake outside of residential settings (e.g. care homes and prisons) where 100% is expected, and the availability of more than 7 million doses in December. The plan also estimates 15-20% of vaccines wasted.

The dates of the rollout:

  - > Care home residents and staff, healthcare workers - from beginning of December;

  - > Ages 80 plus - from mid-December;

  - > Everyone aged 70-80 - from late December;

  - > Everyone aged 65-70 - from early January;

  - > All high and moderate risk under 65s - from early January;

  - > Everyone aged 50-65 - from mid January; and

  - > Everyone aged 18-50 - from late January; but with the bulk of this group vaccinated during March.

Should we worry about anti-vaxxers and non-compliance? If surveys are worth anything, 1 in 6 UK respondents said they would refuse a vaccine. We shall see.

This does mean that initially the vaccines will not provide the sort of herd immunity that can help extinguish an epidemic, let alone a pandemic. EUA makes sense but in the US alone, the National Academy of Sciences estimates that there are 16 million people working in health care, 2.1 million first-responders, and also 2.1 million elderly people living in nursing homes and other residential facilities. So even the first phase of rollout will require tough choices on distribution. Scaling manufacturing as best as we can is the antidote to distribution problems.

[<span class="underline">A Framework for Equitable Allocation of Vaccine for the Novel Coronavirus</span>](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/a-framework-for-equitable-allocation-of-vaccine-for-the-novel-coronavirus#sectionPublications)

There is a proposed way to ensure fair distribution: vaccine lottery, run by place (instead of individual), such as a whole hospital or a nursing home, weighted according to the number of inhabitants, which simplifies logistics and allows for more efficient data collection. Phase 3 trials typically compare 20000 people who got the vaccine with 20000 people who received a placebo, but statistical comparisons require waiting until enough people are exposed to the virus in their normal daily lives. Vaccine allocation by lottery will implicitly create a very large randomised trial. Lotteries are also reasonably straightforward to implement. The main issue would be to ensure that the lottery process is clear and transparent, and thus trustworthy.

[<span class="underline">Fair Allocation of Vaccines, Ventilators and Antiviral Treatments: Leaving No Ethical Value Behind in Health Care Rationing</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00374)

Pfizer and Moderna both say that they can make in the range of 20 million doses by the end of the year, but what we do not know is (1) when the FDA will grant EUA, (2) how many of these doses can be distributed and how it is going to happen, (3) what the number of doses available right now is, (4) how the ramp-up of both production and distribution are going to be coupled in the coming months, (5) what is going to show up with the other vaccine candidates in testing.

\[UPDATE 21/11/20\] FDA just announced the meeting on Pfizer’s EUA to be held on 10 December<sup>15</sup>.

\[UPDATE 23/11/20\] The Pfizer vaccine could get UK approval this week\!

[<span class="underline">Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could get UK approval this week: Telegraph</span>](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-br-idUKKBN2820QU)

Assuming the FDA exercises its EUA powers, the very first people to get these new vaccines will almost surely be health care workers, starting some time in December. The rollout after that has too many variables to usefully predict, but it is going to be the biggest thing of its type ever attempted, in people-per-unit-time. The light is real, but the tunnel at the end of it is still pretty long. Only a tiny amount of people will receive vaccines when Santa comes to town<sup>16</sup>. In the meantime, if you have nothing better to do for the holidays, maybe sell your Zoom stock-ings and buy some Moderna<sup>17</sup> ones.

## Endnotes

1.  > Viral vector vaccines have the advantage of setting off a full range of immunity responses because they contain actual viruses (weakened so they do not replicate). A disadvantage is that it has only once been used in human therapy (the Ebola vaccine), and regular adenovirus infects people anyway so some of the patients may already have antibodies to that one. It also means that booster shots would have an uphill battle. Antibodies to the viral payload? Good. Antibodies to the viral vector itself? Not good.

3.  > The Carlson curve started being profoundly outpaced in 2008 due to maturing next-gen sequencing from Illumina (definitely not the Illuminati), which acquired UK startup Solexa and its gigabase-level sequencing technology in 2007. It remains an open question as to what happened around late 2012, when the exponential price decrease was halted for years, keeping whole-genome sequencing prices high, and thus delaying whole-genome sequencing replacing SNP genotyping in genetics research by up to a decade (with untold medical consequences). Was it just the Illuminati’s fault and a failure of anti-trust law?

4.  > Bacterial genomes are on average 600 times smaller than a human genome, so the costs with sequencing are significantly lower. However, only 15% of the cost of sequencing a bacterial genome goes to the process of gathering the nucleic bases from the sequencing machine. For a human genome, it is closer to 70%, because it takes many more reads to achieve a working level of sequence coverage for a 3-billion-base-pair human genome than a bacterial one, but sample preparation and library construction costs do not necessarily scale with genome size or read coverage.

6.  > Computing power and storage capacity are nonetheless bottlenecks because sequencing generates a lot of raw data. The 1000 Genomes project data, for example, consists of 200 terabytes (1 terabyte is 1,024 gigabytes) for the 1700 participants in 2014.

> The first SARS-CoV-2 strain sequenced on 18 March 2020: Wuhan-Hu-1, has 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits. Therefore, in theory the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store.

7.  > There is still room for GWS to improve. The Netherlands, for example, has been using an amplicon-based sequencing approach, which relies on close, reliable reference sequences that are designed based on current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 diversity and therefore need regular updating. However, at the moment, conventional metagenomic sequencing from Illumina takes too long for near to real-time sequencing, and nanopore-based metagenomic sequencing is not sensitive enough to allow recovery of whole-genome sequences in a similar fashion and costs compared to amplicon-based nanopore sequencing. In the future, this may be overcome using metagenomic sequencing.

8.  > An early form of vaccination was called "variolation" or "inoculation". The oldest practice was an ancient Asian technique of blowing dried smallpox scabs up the nose to infect the person with a milder form of the disease. By the 1700s, variolation had spread to Africa, India and the Ottoman Empire, followed by the UK and America, where skin puncture was more frequently performed. In 1796 English physician Edward Jenner observed that an infection with cowpox can protect against smallpox. In a move that will make current-day ethics boards think you are Literally Hitler, Jenner used matter from a cowpox lesion to inoculate his gardener's 8-year-old son, who was then exposed to smallpox lesion matter after 2 months. He did not develop smallpox so Jenner concluded that the wee child was protected against the disease, and coined the procedure as "vaccination".

9.  > The Lyme vaccine LYMErix™ serves as a cautionary tale on risk communication by physicians and mass media, which can pre-empt clinical trials. In 1998, the FDA approved the new recombinant Lyme vaccine, which reduced new infections in adults by 80%. Just 3 years later, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew its product from the market amidst falling sales, extensive media coverage of “vaccine victims”, and ongoing litigation, even though studies show that it was a cost-effective public health intervention for high-risk patients. The withdrawal represented a loss of a powerful tool for Lyme disease prevention.

12. > The first step in vaccine manufacturing is the establishment of a “master cell bank”: a collection of vialed cells that form the starting material for all future production. Viruses are grown in either primary cells (e.g. chicken fibroblasts for yellow fever vaccine), or continuous cell lines (e.g. MRC-5 for hepatitis A vaccine). Bacterial pathogens are grown in bioreactors using media carefully optimised for the yield of the antigen while maintaining its integrity. Recombinant proteins can be manufactured in bacteria, yeast, or cell cultures. The next step is to isolate the antigen from the growth medium. This can be isolation of free virus, proteins from cells, or cells containing the antigen. The antigens are then purified using column chromatography, ultrafiltration, or simple inactivation of the isolated virus.

> The formulation of the vaccine is designed to maximise the stability, distribution efficiency, and proper delivery. The formulated vaccine may include an adjuvant to enhance the immune response, stabilisers to prolong shelf life, and preservatives to allow multi-dose vials to be delivered. All components that constitute the final vaccine are uniformly mixed in a single vessel. Individual, scrupulously cleaned, depyrogenated, single or multi-dose containers are then filled with the vaccine and sealed with sterile stoppers or plungers.
