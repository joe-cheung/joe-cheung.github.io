[Epistemic status: I have no expertise, and news about COVID-19 changes by the minute, but below is my best guess from what I have read so far.]
[Please bear with weird links/reference format, one day I will hyperlink the text]

## I. Overview

Pfizer and BioNTech just concluded their phase 3 analysis of their messenger RNA (mRNA) candidate and reports it to be 95% effective, with 162 infection cases in the placebo group versus 8 in the vaccine group in the 43000-patient trial. The vaccine is well tolerated and there are minimal severe side-effects (a.k.a. grade 3 adverse events) including fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2.0%). It will require 2 doses 21 days apart and cannot be removed from -70°C more than 4 times, which poses a massive distribution challenge. Nonetheless, it is fantastic news.

Moderna reports in their first interim analysis of their phase 3 trial that their own mRNA candidate is 94.5% effective, with 90 infection cases in the placebo group versus 5 cases in the vaccine group in the 30000-patient trial. The vaccine is generally well tolerated, with short-lived grade 3 adverse events such as fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), and pain (4.1%). It will also require 2 doses, 4 weeks apart. Most groundbreaking is that their vaccine remains stable up to 6 months under standard freezer condition (-20°C), up to 30 days under normal fridge condition (4°C), and up to 12 hours in room temperature, which means significantly easier distribution and storage with the existing infrastructure.

The Oxford viral vector1 (weakened chimpanzee adenovirus modified to express the spike protein) vaccine was in the lead before its trials were briefly suspended when two patients got ill. Interim analysis of the data from its phase 2/3 trial and a parallel phase 3 trial found one dosing regimen (n=2,741) to show efficacy of 90% when the vaccine was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. I have no idea why a first full dose has lower efficacy than a first half dose. There is no information on side effects, but there are hospitalisations or severe infection cases in participants. The vaccine can be stored and transported at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 °C) for at least six months.

Meanwhile in Russia (with the usual caveats), the Sputnik V viral vector (modified human adenovirus) vaccine has shown 92% effectiveness in its 40000-patient phase 3 trial.

The Chinese Sinovac Biotech vaccine was reported to elicit quick immune response and is at least found to be safe in its Brazil trial. There has yet to be any published data from its phase 2 and 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates, but that has not stopped a reported 60000 people to receive it in emergency-authorised use, including the Chinese military and to some employees of Chinese state-owned enterprises. China has a safe vaccine, just not for you!

It is important to note that these results were only published in bare-bones press releases, and there is no information about whether asymptomatic infection is also protected, nor whether severity of symptoms is reduced. On the other hand, all other candidates, including around 10 currently in phase 3 trials, are designed to block SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, so it is quite likely that the aforementioned candidates will not be the only ones that prove efficacious. The expected value of delaying getting sick just went way up! So stay home and stay safe.

We will only find out how long immunity from the vaccines will last by waiting and watching, and the pandemic is just barely a year old so we do not have long term data on natural immune response. That said, a paper found that memory B cells specific to spike protein (virus-specific protein that gives it the crown-like appearance) were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month, while SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months. Another paper found that IgA and IgM antibodies were short-lived (seronegative by 51 and 47 days post-symptoms), while IgG antibodies lasted longer (at least 75 days post-symptoms). Yet another paper found that functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are retained for at least six months. The literature paints a consistent picture of a strong, normal, lasting immune response in the vast majority of patients. Also, early vaccine data suggests antibody responses at least as strong as those found in naturally infected cases. Hence, there is (so far) every reason to think that vaccine-based immunity will be as good or better than that conferred by an actual infection.

With regards to viral mutation, a Pfizer paper found that many of the common mutations are as susceptible to antibodies raised by their vaccine. Also, SARS-COV-2 does not have the re-assortment mechanism that allows influenza virus to change so easily and quickly that warrants annual vaccination. There is an effort to monitor developing mutations so that such issues can be dealt with swiftly.

Another worry is efficacy in different demographics, but fortunately the Pfizer vaccine demonstrated 94% efficacy in patients 65 and older. Pfizer also claims that 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. However, there are no numbers yet for people with pre-existing conditions and risk factors.

## II. The story of the mRNA

While there are about 200 candidates globally, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the only ones that rely on mRNA, a completely novel technology that was a scientific backwater before it was a multibillion-dollar idea.

The concept of mRNA therapeutics was first demonstrated to work in mice in 1990, but even though it is easier and quicker to manufacture, not to mention safer, compared to traditional DNA and protein based therapeutics, no mRNA vaccine nor drug has ever been approved. mRNA is notoriously unstable as free RNA breaks down quickly, posing a significant in vivo (in live cell) delivery challenge. mRNA injected into the body might also elicit unintended immune response, which is the stumbling block that has led to most of the rejections of grant applications for its research.

For Katalin Karikó, the Hungarian-born biochemist, mRNA was a career dead-end. Her grant applications were all rejected, and she was even demoted from her path to full professorship. But after a decade of trial and error with collaborator Drew Weisman, an immunology MD, PhD, they discovered in 2005 that by modifying a nucleoside (building block of mRNA), mRNA can penetrate its target cells without eliciting an immune response. This key discovery did not go unnoticed by the future founders of Moderna and BioNTech.

Derrick Rossi was a Canadian stem cell biology postdoctoral fellow at Stanford when he first came across Karikó and Weisman’s work . With another postdoctoral fellow, they discovered that modified mRNA can reprogram adult cells to act like embryonic stem cells that have the potential to develop into any cell. Embryonic stem cells are the holy grail of regenerative medicine, and Rossi's discovery can completely sidestep the ethical controversy of harvesting them from discarded embryos.

Rossi, who is now a professor at Harvard Medical School, informed his colleague and biotech entrepreneur Timothy Springer, and the two contacted Robert Langer, a prolific inventor and legendary biochemical engineering professor at MIT. Rossi then presented his findings to Noubar Afeyan, founder of Flagship Ventures. Within a several months, Rossi, Langer, Afeyan, and another physician-researcher found Moderna2, a pun on modified RNA.

In Germany, husband and wife Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci, both Turkish immigrant and immunology physicians-scientists, co-founded BioNTech as a spin-off of another biotech startup they previously co-founded. Like Moderna, BioNTech licensed technology developed by Karikó and Weissman. In fact, BioNTech hired Karikó in 2013. When Şahin read about the COVID-19 in China in January, he realised BioNTech required a strong partner to manufacture the vaccine and reached out to the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which BioNTech worked with before to try to develop mRNA influenza vaccines.
