This is a new blog by Joe Cheung. I made it to share my long [essay](_posts/2020-11-19-COVID-19-Vaccines.md) about COVID-19 vaccines. I also made the blog to make myself write more.

I hope you find the essays useful or at least entertaining â€“ but like [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About), the intended audience is my future self, who is interested but has forgotten.

If you want to stay tuned to what I have to write next, subscribe via [Atom/RSS](_site/feed.xml) or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SubCriticalA). You can also reach me at subcriticalappraisal@gmail.com.
